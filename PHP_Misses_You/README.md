This is a basic talk about becoming refamiliarized with PHP and modern
PHP development. This talk could prove useful to someone looking to
apply modern development techniques to PHP but not knowing exactly where
to start, or someone who is stuck in the old world of PHP and who wants
to becoming familiarized with newer standards, practices, libraries, and
language features.
